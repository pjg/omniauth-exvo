# omniauth-exvo

Stub at making an omniauth 1.0 compatible authentication gem for Exvo.

Both `interactive` and `non_interactive` authentication methods work.

## TODO

* add specs
* add some support for `fail!` for `non_interactive` so that we have some errors instead of silently failing
* add old "config" so that we have different hosts for different environments
